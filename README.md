# ResistorSorter

## Introduction
Resistors are an integral part of the Electronics world, and our club is no different. But due to their small size, it becomes very hard to keep track of them and get collected to form heaps which makes it very hard to find a resistor of a particular value. Thus, our project presents a solution to this problem. In our project, we are able to segregate a particular resistor from other resistors through the technique called computer vision. 

For the implementation of the resistor sorter technique, computer vision is used. For checking the presence of a resistor, color masking is used. To know the orientation of the resistor, firstly, the position of the tolerance band is known after the remaining color bands are extracted. Once the value is calculated, we use the conveyor belt to move it to the right side.
